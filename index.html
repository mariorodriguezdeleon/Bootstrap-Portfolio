                <p>I'm a husband to a wonderful lady by the name of Emily, and a father to two adorable little children 
                – Audrey, and her little brother Benjamin; we also have a Boston Terrier that is a ball of energy.<br><br>
                My Hobbies and past times include spending time with my family, playing video games, magic the gathering, D&D, and reading (not just for work either); 
                I try to make time for as many activities as possible. When I do find myself with a bit of extra time, I like tinkering in my garage, either monkeying around with IC’s (integrated circuits and sensors), 
                my various servers, or working on small carpentry projects.
                I really like figuring out new things and experimenting with different technologies and gadgets.  I'm a Technical Project Manager / Solutions Architect by trade,
                but an engineer at heart.<br><br>
                I enjoy playing Racket Ball, and make it a must to pickup a couple of games on a weekly basis.
                I alos enjoy the outdoors, and I try to get out on the trail as often as possible.   
                </p>
